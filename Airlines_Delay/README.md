# ✈️ Flight Delays Analysis – Power BI Dashboard  

This repository contains my **Power BI dashboard** built for the **FP20 Analytics Challenge**, where I analyzed flight delay patterns using the dataset provided. The project includes **detailed documentation, key insights, and the Power BI file** with interactive visualizations.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Flight delays impact millions of passengers worldwide. This dashboard provides a **data-driven approach** to understanding the causes, patterns, and trends in flight delays, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.  

## 🔍 Key Insights & Findings  
✔️ **Delay Trends** – Identified peak times and routes prone to delays  
✔️ **Airline Performance** – Comparative analysis of delay rates across airlines  
✔️ **Weather & Delay Correlation** – Analyzed the impact of weather conditions on delays  
✔️ **Airport Analysis** – Pinpointed airports with the highest delay occurrences  
✔️ **Operational Insights** – Recommendations for reducing delays  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
📁 **Dashboard/** – The `.pbix` Power BI file with interactive visualizations  
📁 **Documentation/** – Detailed write-ups on the approach, methodology, and insights
